If you are reading this, you most definitely have something
better to do.

## Reporting bugs

Do *NOT* report bugs. If you report bugs as [this fool
did](https://github.com/aweeraman/wtfshell/issues/1), I will call you
names and just close them. This sh#t isn't expected to work.

In the off-chance that this does something you expect and you find it
useful, please do report a bug and I will have it fixed immediately.

## How to contribute

Why? See: Reporting bugs.

Cautionary tale: [crushing an idiot's first attempt at contributing to this crap](https://github.com/aweeraman/wtfshell/pull/2). Nip that sh#t in the bud.
