# WTF shell. Absolutely useless. Don't waste your time.

This is a useless Unix shell that does nothing of importance.
If you are reading this, you most definitely have something
better to do.

## Reporting Bugs

Do *NOT* report bugs. If you report bugs as [this fool
did](https://github.com/aweeraman/wtfshell/issues/1), I will call you
names and just close them. This sh#t isn't expected to work.

In the off-chance that this does something you expect and you find it
useful, please do report a bug and I will have it fixed immediately.
